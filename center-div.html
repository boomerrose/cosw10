        <h2>1.Always Sunny In Philadelphia</h2>
        <h4>Comedy</h4>
        <p>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is a wonderful option to stream whether you are sitting down for one episode or looking to put in some serious couch time with some popcorn and snacks. This show has been one of my favorites since it originally debuted. With a satirical approach to life and outrageous hijinks, you will be sure to laugh out loud and continuously hit watch the next episode. </p>

    <h2>2.A Million Little Things</h2>
        <h4>Drama</h4>
        <p>If you want to invest time into watching interpersonal relationships between characters develop and grow, this is the show for you. A Million Little Pieces creates a beautiful story of the power of friendship, love, and resilience. With a cast of characters you will grow to love, my favorites being Eddie and Gary, prepare for laughs, tears, and cliffhangers. A Million Little Things tackles current events and real-life challenges that will leave you anticipating the next season as I am now.</p>

    <h2>3.For All Man Kind</h2>
        <h4>Drama</h4>
        <p>What if the space race did not end? That is the question that For All Man Kind tackles throughout its story. Currently, in its 3rd season, the show creates an exciting and moving storyline. With characters, you will root for scenarios that could never be dreamed For All Man Kind blends historical events and fiction in a mesmerizing way. Prepare to sit back, binge-watch the available episodes, and follow NASA as they attempt to beat Russia and private space companies to Mars. </p>

        <h2>4.The Boys</h2>
        <h4>Drama/Action</h4>
        <p>I had never been a fan of superhero shows or movies until I was introduced to The Boys. This show is far removed from the DC or Marvel universes and is gritty at its core. It is filled with action and a storyline that keeps the viewer watching. It takes a different approach to the lives of superheroes and their origins. It is currently on its 3rd season, so there is still plenty of time to call dominos, order some pizza, and get caught up on The Boys. You won't regret it. </p>

    <h2>5.Power</h2>
        <h4>Drama</h4>
        <p>Power explores the world of the illegal drug trade. Following a New York King Pin and his crew, we watch as the main character "Ghost" attempts to blend his secret with being a respectable businessman without getting caught by the Feds. If you are looking for a show to binge-watch from beginning to end, this is a must-watch as it has already filmed its series finale. Besides the main character, well-developed supporting characters have resulted in multiple series spin-offs. There is so much to discover in the universe that is Power. </p>
